Attempt at connecting signage and traffic interventions in NYC, with motor vehicle crashes.  A/B testing of sorts.

We look for the impact of an intervention - like, a stop sign,  
pedestrian light.
Depending on the success of these, we would like to replicate it  
in other places that are similar, and see accidents.  

Divying that up, this gives us two problems: 
1. how to analyze the impact of the intervention  
2. how to identify "similar" intersections.  
3. how to rank the possible intersections in order, i.e. which ones to target first? What's the criteria and how do we know the impact at those intersections would be the greatest?
